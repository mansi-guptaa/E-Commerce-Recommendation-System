## Introduction  
In the era of digital transformation, e-commerce platforms provide an extensive range of products, which can overwhelm users when making choices. This project addresses the challenge of delivering personalized product recommendations to enhance user experience. By employing machine learning techniques, the system offers tailored suggestions using approaches like content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods.  

## Objective  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust recommendation system to improve product discoverability and customer engagement on e-commerce platforms.  

## Data  
The project uses a dataset containing 5,000 rows of sample data, including product attributes, user ratings, and interaction data, sourced from Walmart.com. The dataset includes key features like product ID, name, category, brand, description, rating, and review count, preprocessed and cleaned for analysis.  

## Recommendation Techniques  

### 1. Content-Based Filtering  
- Recommends products similar to those a user has interacted with based on item attributes.  
- Utilized **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to analyze product descriptions and **Cosine Similarity** to calculate item similarity.  

### 2. Collaborative Filtering  
- Suggests products by identifying users with similar preferences using a user-item interaction matrix.  
- Techniques include **Matrix Factorization** and neighborhood-based methods to predict user-item interactions.  

### 3. Hybrid Approach  
- Combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to generate more accurate and diverse recommendations.  
- Provides a balanced approach by leveraging both user preferences and product similarities.  


## Tools and Libraries  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

## Features and Outcomes  
- Implemented advanced recommendation algorithms to deliver personalized suggestions.  
- Integrated recommendation logic into an e-commerce interface, showcasing real-time recommendations tailored to user preferences.  
- Enhanced user engagement and product visibility, improving the likelihood of conversions and customer satisfaction.
